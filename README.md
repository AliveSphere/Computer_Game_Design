# One Life is missing it's main song file, "TailsTheme.wav", as the file size was too large for me to upload.

# One Life is a game that I conceptualized, which was voted to be our group's project,.
# I first created a game engine to use as the environment the game could run in.
# After the engine was complete, I worked on One Life in a 3 man group setting until it's completion.
